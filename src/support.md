# Support this work

Hi :wave:,

If you like Describo and find it useful, please consider supporting it. There are different ways to
help but this page is about financial support. All of the Describo components are free to use -
**forever**. But that doesn't mean they are free to create.

So, if you can support the work, please head on over to my Github Sponsors page:

<div class="bg-slate-100 rounded-lg text-xl p-4 text-center">
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/marcolarosa" target="_blank">https://github.com/sponsors/marcolarosa</a>
</div>

Alternately, you can reach out to me via email (m@lr.id.au) to discuss other options for supporting
the work.

My goal is to keep building out the environment, and keep supporting the HASS community with tools
that should exist by now, but still don't!

Thankyou, <br/>Marco -->
