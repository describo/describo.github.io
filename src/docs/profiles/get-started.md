## Profile versions - READ THIS

::: info

If you are writing a profile for Describo Online
[see the documentation with that repository](https://github.com/Arkisto-Platform/describo-online/wiki/Writing-a-domain-specific-profile).

This repository describes profiles for the
[Crate Builder Component](https://github.com/describo/crate-builder-component) which are an
evolution of those.

## Sharing your profile

Example profiles from specific domains can be seen in the
[domain profiles folder](https://github.com/describo/profiles/tree/master/domain-profiles). If you'd
like to publish your own profile for others to work with or use please submit a pull request to this
repository. You must:

-   create a folder preferably named by your domain in the `domain-profiles` folder.
-   name your profiles in there in some sensible way.

Optionally, add a README to your folder - absolutely recommended but not an essential requirement.
