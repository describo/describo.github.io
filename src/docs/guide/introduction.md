# Describo Desktop User Guide

Hi :wave:,

If you're here then you've installed Describo (or are about to!) and are ready to start using it.

You have some data that you want to describe and you've heard that RO-Crate is the way to do it.
Whether you are creating a research dataset for publication or just want to leave some metadata in a
folder for later, Describo will help you. If you have digitised content (images and documents) you
have access to tools to help you transcribe it and recognise / mark up the entities you find.
Likewise, the Describo assistant can help you to easily uncover what's in your data.

Read on to find out more about the components of the application; find out what each does and
understand when and why you would use them.
