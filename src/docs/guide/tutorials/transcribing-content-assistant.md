# Using the assistant

As you are transcribing your content, you are also marking up entities that are found in that
content. That markup, as seen in the previous tutorial is stored as data attributes in the
transcription and also the metadata.

The next step is developing and enriching your description of the content by using the assistant to
interrogate the text; potentially from differing perspectives.

In the following images, the assistant is first used to summarise the text and describe the main
topics. Then, acting as an anthropologist (ie prompting it to assume a particular role), the
assistant is again asked what the main topics are. After that, the assistant is asked to assume the
role of a social scientist to explain the narrative with respect to any cultural symbolism. Finally
(the second image), the assistant is asked to explain whether the narrator is a part of the event.

In each case, the assistant provides a detailed answer with evidence from the text to support its
commentary.

As the conversation is happening, all or part of it can be transcribed into the description fields
on the right hand side. In addition, defined terms can be created from this content (or whatever you
wish to define yourself) and associated to the file.

When we navigate back to the describe tab we see the descriptions and defined terms that we added
previously.

Moving onto another image we can again engage the assistant to describe the text and when we go to
add defined terms, not only can we create new ones but we can also look up existing terms that have
been defined in the metadata. Notice the dropdown in the image shows the defined terms we created
for the first page?

As before, when we navigate to the describe tab, we see the description entries and defined terms
associated to the file.
