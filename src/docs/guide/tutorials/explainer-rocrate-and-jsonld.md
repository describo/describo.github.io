# Explainer: JSON-LD and RO-Crate

## JSON-LD

-   JSON (Javascript Object Notation) -
    `is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.`
    [https://www.json.org/json-en.html](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
-   LD (Linked Data) -
    `linked data is structured data which is interlinked with other data so it becomes more useful through semantic queries.`
    &nbsp;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data)

-   JSON-LD -
    `JSON-LD is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale`

## RO-Crate

-   RO-Crate (Research Object Crate) -
    `RO-Crate is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata. It is based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wider variety of situations, from an individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large data-intensive computational research environments.`
