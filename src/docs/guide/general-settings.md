# Configuring Describo

<ImageComponent src="/images/tour/desktop18.webp" />

In the General Settings sections you can control the following:

-   Zoom in and out to increase / decrease the font size of the application
-   Set the language to use
-   Configure where tabs are shown if defined in a profile
-   Save metadata updates automatically on change
-   Purge unlinked Entities. When an entity is unlinked, if it was only linked in one place then at
    that point, it is not reachable via the graph. With this setting enabled, unlinked entities and
    subtress will automatically be purged from the graph.
-   Configure which files and folders the file manage should hide.

Be sure to save the configuration when you're done.

## Show Developer Tools

As this application is in active development, from time to time there may be bugs and these will
show up in what's called 'Developer Tools'. When reporting any issues you encounter, please
`Show Developer Tools` and take a screenshot of the whole application.

## Reset

::: danger

This is really only for development but you can use it too. This will delete all of the application
internal state - including: your previously used profiles; all settings; credentials - everything!

IT WILL NOT DELETE YOUR DATA. IT APPLIES TO THE INTERNAL STATE OF THE APPLICATION ONLY.
