# Purchase Credits

You can purchase credits as soon as you've registered with describo.cloud. When you click the link
on the Dashboard panel a page will open in your browser where you will see:

<ImageComponent src="/images/configuration/purchase1.webp" />

If you are just getting started and want to try all of the capabilities, purchase **General
Credits**. As you get to know the services, you can top up the credits for specific components as
required.

Selecting the credits you wish to purchase will open the payment providers dialog:

<ImageComponent src="/images/configuration/purchase2.webp" />

If the payment is successful you will see:

<div class="flex flex-row space-x-2">
    <ImageComponent src="/images/configuration/purchase3.webp" />
    <ImageComponent src="/images/configuration/purchase4.webp" />
</div>
